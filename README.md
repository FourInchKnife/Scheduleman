# Schedule Man
ScheduleMan is an implementation of the example ScheduleMan plugin in my [EasyPluginBot][epb] repo.

It uses the prefix `s!` for all of the commands:
- **poll** Starts a reaction-based poll
- **days** Starts a scheduling poll with letters for the days of the week
- **info** Gives info about the bot and useful links for it
- **help** Prints out all of the commands and their uses

#### If you want to look through the code

I'm sorry. I really, really am. It is total spaghetti. It needs more comments. It doesn't use a super useful feature. Trust me, I'm working on it.

Take a look at the [EPB docs][ghpages] for setup and more information.
